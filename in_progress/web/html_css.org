* Structure

Create a structure for each project which contains the following

- ~css~ (for style sheets)
- ~img~ (for images)
- ~js~ (for java script files)
- other files to keep a nice strucure if it's a big project

If it's a smaller project you can keep all ~html~ files in the root directory.
The ~index.html~ file should be in the root directory since this is the file
which will automatically be opened when navigating to that directory on a web
hosting service

* id vs classes

ids should uniquely identify an object while a class can be applied to many
objects

* Pseudo classes

E.g. ~a:hover~, ~li:nth-child(3)~ or ~ul:first-of-type~
