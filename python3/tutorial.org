* Test code to check python versions

The ~python~ argument in the code block header accepts a path to your python
executable. I have both =python2= and =python3= in my path so that's why I can
write only the name of the executable. Evaluate the code by placing the cursor
inside the code block and press ~C-c C-c~

The following code block evaluates python2 code:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :python python2 :results output
import sys
print(sys.version)
#+END_SRC

And this code block evaluates python3 code:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :python python3 :results output
import sys
print(sys.version)
#+END_SRC
