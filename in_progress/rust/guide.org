** Installation

https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html

Or on fedora linux:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeval
sudo dnf install rust
rustc --version
sudo dnf install cargo # Rust's package manager and build tool
cargo --version
sudo dnf install rustfmt # Rust formatting
cargo install rust-script # Run rust files as scripts. Needed for emacs babel
                          # Make sure the script is on your path afterwards!
rust-script --version
#+END_SRC

** Hello, World

Files in rust are on the format ~programname.rs~. Words should be separated with ~_~.

#+BEGIN_SRC rust :results output
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
#+END_SRC

*** Compile it

Add the code from the file above in a file called ~hello_world.rs~, compile it
with ~rustc~ and execute the produced file, ~~hello_world~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeva
rustc hello_world.rs
./hello_world
#+END_SRC

*** Things to note

1. The main ~function~ is special: it is always the first code that runs in
   every executable Rust program. The first line declares a function named main
   that has no parameters and returns nothing. If there were parameters, they
   would go inside the parentheses, ~()~.
2. ~println!~ calls a Rust macro. If it called a function instead, it would be
   entered as ~println~ (without the ~!~).
3. Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab. Run
   ~rustfmt hello_world.rs~ to format code according to the standard.

** Hello, Cargo

Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading
the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.

All code in this section is available in the [[file:001_hello_cargo][001_hello_cargo]] directory.

*** Creating a project

In a directory where you want to create a project, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeval
cargo new hello_cargo
cd hello_cargo
#+END_SRC

This created the following file structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC
.
`-- hello_cargo
    |-- Cargo.toml
    `-- src
        `-- main.rsl
#+END_SRC

The ~Cargo.toml~ file looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
#+END_SRC

The ~[package]~ heading, is a section heading that indicates that the following
statements are configuring a package.

The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile
your program: the name, the version, and the edition of Rust to use.

The ~[dependencies]~ heading, is the start of a section for you to list any of
your projectâ€™s dependencies (known as /crates/ in Rust).

Cargo expects your source files to live inside the src directory. The top-level
project directory is just for README files, license information, configuration
files, and anything else not related to your code.

*** Building and Running a Cargo Project

To build the project, run the followin command while standing in the
~hello_cargo~ directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeval
cargo build
#+END_SRC

A file is then created in ~target/debug/hello_cargo~. Run it by running the
following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeval
./target/debug/hello_cargo
#+END_SRC

You may notice that ~cargo build~ also creates a ~Cargo.lock~ in the top level
directory. This file keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your
project. Cargo understands [[https://semver.org/][Semantic Versioning]]. If you specify the version
~0.8.3~ this is actually a shorthand for ~^0.8.3~, meaning any version that is
at least ~0.8.3~ but below ~0.9.0~. Between builds the ~Cargo.lock~ file will
guarantee that the same version is used until you explicitly upgrade the
version. You should never need to update this file manually. If you want to make
cargo to reevaluate the version (finding a suitable version at least ~0.8.3~ but
below ~0.9.0~) you can run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeval
cargo update
#+END_SRC

You can both compile and run the project in one step by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeval
cargo run
#+END_SRC

Cargo will automatically what needs to be recompiled and what doesn't.

If you only want to make sure that the project compiles but not actually compile
the project you can run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeval
cargo check
#+END_SRC

This is much faster than actually compiling the code during development.

*** Building for release

You maybe noticed that the compile binary ended up in ~target/debug~. This is
a development build. They are faster to compile but are not optimized. In order
to optimize the build (which will also increase the build time) you should run
the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeval
cargo build --release
# --release can be used with run as well
cargo run --release
#+END_SRC

This result will end up in ~target/release~ now.

* Documentation

Another neat feature of Cargo is that you can run the command below, which will
build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and open it in
your browser.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :noeval
cargo doc --open
#+END_SRC

* Misc

#+BEGIN_SRC rust :noeval
let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
#+END_SRC
